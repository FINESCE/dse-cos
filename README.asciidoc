== DSE-COS ==
The WP5 Stream I team have developed an active demand dispatch system as a FINESCE domain specific enabler. This system optimises charging profiles for available Electric Vehicles (EV)s on the grid, by taking input of power generation forecasts from system operatorsâ€˜ web sites and using request-response message exchange patterns with live EVSE's connected to the grid to create an optimised load scheduler every 15 minutes.
